## About Tracely

Tracely is a B2B data service that helps UK pension providers, insurers, and investment managers reconnect with "gone-away" customers who have moved home. Unlike traditional credit reference agencies that lag 6-12 weeks behind, Tracely captures move data in real-time at the point of tenancy agreement signing or property completion.

### Key Facts
- Parent company: Just Move In
- Market: UK Financial Services (pensions, insurance, investments)
- Core technology: Real-time move data triangulation
- Data advantage: 6-12 weeks faster than credit reference agencies
- Compliance: GDPR compliant, FCA Consumer Duty aligned, ICO registered

### The Problem We Solve
- £31.1 billion in unclaimed UK pensions
- 3.3 million lost customers across financial services
- 60% growth in gone-away customers since 2018
- Traditional tracing methods cost £50-100+ per customer with 6-8 week delays

### Our Solution
Tracely uses triangulation matching: we verify customer identity by matching the customer, their old address, their new address, and the move date. This provides high-confidence reconnection data before customers become "gone-away."

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What is a gone-away customer?
A: A gone-away customer is someone who has moved home without updating their address with their pension provider, insurer, or investment manager. This results in returned mail, failed communications, and eventually dormant accounts.

Q: How is Tracely different from credit reference agencies?
A: Tracely captures move data at the point of tenancy signing or property completion - typically 6-12 weeks before this information reaches credit reference agencies. We also use triangulation (matching customer + old address + new address + date) for higher confidence matches.

Q: What industries does Tracely serve?
A: Tracely serves UK financial services including pension providers, life insurers, annuity providers, investment managers, and closed-book scheme administrators.

Q: How much does Tracely cost?
A: Tracely offers three pricing models: Per-Match (pay only for verified matches), Success Fee (pay when customers engage), and API Subscription (unlimited access for high-volume clients). Typical costs are £25-50 per match vs £50-100+ for traditional tracing.

Q: Is Tracely GDPR compliant?
A: Yes. Tracely is fully GDPR compliant, ICO registered, and designed to support FCA Consumer Duty requirements for maintaining customer contact.
